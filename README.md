# KeyboardShortcuts

Practice repo for basic IDE keyboard shortcuts

Complete the challenges bellow, only using keyboard shortcuts, each time you come across a new shortcut make a note of
it. If you don't know the shortcut needed, 1st try to use your ide to find it and then try searching the internet.

1. Navigation
    1. Split the editor. (You should now see two copies README.md displayed and the cursor focused in the right hand
       editor)
    2. Swap between the two editor groups a few times and end up in the left hand editor
    3. Open the parrot.test.ts
    4. Goto line 20 character 28
    5. Go to the definition of the Parrot constructor,  use the go to code functionality
    6. Move the parrot.ts file between the two editor groups a few times and end with the file in the left hand window
    7. Go back to the parrot.test.ts file
    8. Close the parrot.test.ts file
    9. Reopen the file
    10. Close all the files apart from the README.md

2. Make some space
    1. Toggle between fullscreen and non fullscreen mode
    2. Show and hide the sidebar
    3. Show and hide the terminal
    4. Enter and exit focus mode - VS code calls this zen mode

3. Moving code without copy and paste

5. New files
    1. create a file called even.test.ts
    2. add a simple test case for an isEven function
